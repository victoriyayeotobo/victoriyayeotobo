## Experience and Skills

Through a series of academic projects and independent research, I have built practical skills in:

- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**:  
  Cleaned, prepared, and explored complex datasets using Python (pandas, NumPy) to uncover meaningful patterns and prepare data for modeling.

- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**:  
  Developed predictive models using scikit-learn and deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, including experience with CNNs, LSTMs, GRUs, and BERT for real-world challenges.

- **Statistical Thinking and Business Problem Solving**:  
  Applied statistical concepts and non-ML approaches to frame business questions, perform exploratory analysis (EDA), and drive decision-making without overfitting technical solutions.

- **Visualization and Communication**:  
  Created clear and actionable dashboards and visual reports using Tableau, matplotlib, and seaborn to present findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

- **Tools and Workflow**:  
  Managed end-to-end data science workflows in Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab, using Git for version control and collaborative project management.

- **Mindset**:  
  I believe in mastering the data science lifecycle — valuing exploration, careful problem framing, and critical thinking throughout every stage — not just optimizing for final results.
