# Hi, I'm Victor Otobo

I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science at Coventry University, where I’ve focused on building machine learning models and solving real-world data challenges.

Over time, I’ve developed my skills by working directly with real data — cleaning messy datasets, understanding business problems, and using machine learning when it made sense. I believe that good data science isn’t just about building models; it’s about asking the right questions, understanding the data deeply, and choosing the best approach, whether it’s statistical, analytical, or machine learning-based.

## Experience and Tools

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:  
  Learned to prepare and structure real-world data for analysis and modeling using Python (pandas, NumPy).

- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**:  
  Gained hands-on experience training models with scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras across different domains like NLP, forecasting, and classification.

- **Problem Solving and Business Understanding**:  
  Applied statistical thinking and domain understanding to solve business problems — not just relying on ML but exploring non-ML approaches when needed.

- **Visualization and Reporting**:  
  Used tools like Tableau and matplotlib to make complex results clear, actionable, and understandable for different audiences.

- **Workflow and Collaboration**:  
  Worked with Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, and Git to manage, document, and track projects end-to-end.

- **Mindset**:  
  I enjoy the full process — exploring the data, finding the story behind it, solving real problems — not just focusing on final outcomes.
